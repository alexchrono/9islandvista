<p> Nine island Vista lies within Point Pleasant report, which is brimming with amenities to make your stay truly memorable.
     If saltwater is not your thing, the resort hosts 5 pools for you to relax around and enjoy the carribean sun.
    Need to work in paradise?  Our unit features dsl internet and wifi, but if that not's enough you may want to check out the captain's quarters
    where you are free to stop by, log in, and enjoy free complimentary coffee.

    And what would paradise be without a mai-thai?  Feel free to enjoy a drink whether it be by the poolside bar, the resort's own "bar by the sea", or
    margaritaville which is a short five minute walk away.

    You are all probably wondering the most important question:  How far am I from the beach.  The answer?  Not far at all.  Easily within walking distance
    (click HERE to view the location link.)  Below we've highlighted the beaches within walking distance.  My personal favorite is "mermaid's cove",
     a small private beach that is a five minute walk from the unit.  Nearby you will also see KOKI beach, which is home to some of the best snorkling in the area.

     Food?  Entertainment?  If our fully functional kitchen is not providing you with your needs, there is an abundance to choose from.  Whether it be grabbing a quick
     snack from the foodside bar, stopping by the resort restaurant, walking over to margaritaville, or venturing into nearby redhook where you will have access to over
     30 restaurants.
